  /// How does this work:
  /// based on the number of work-sets, various durations and lead times,
  /// this method calculates the individual events and when exactly they
  /// take place.
  /// Then all the events are sorted chronologically, so that a simple
  /// timer-based replay can be used to call back the user interface
  /// and business logic. As a reaction to each event, the 'current training'
  /// display can be updated and either sound or voice can be replayed
  /// at the right time.
  /// This decouples any state management from the [Training] itself.
  /// The called-back code can do this as needed.
  ///
  /// This makes it also quite simple to set up and verify the choreography
  /// of a training.
  ///
  /// During execution, this also should allow for easy pause / resumed
  /// operations.
